## Project Overview

### Project Name: Mr. Fun Teacher
#### Taglines:
- Helping kids learn since 2024
- Math is boring, Batman is not
- Learning Legends
- The Homework Heroes
- Fun with Facts
- EduVenturers

### Project Description
Our goal is to use AI to teach kids more effectively by personalizing educational materials, such as texts and problem sets, to make homework and reading more interesting for kids. For example, a 3rd grader who dislikes math but loves Batman can learn math through a story about Batman. Our application uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI to restructure educational content into themed, story-driven problems, making them more engaging for children. This application targets teachers, educators, parents, and anyone involved in educational planning for students.

Using AI in this innovative way aims to provide better education to children, particularly in underserved communities. Our primary learning goals include understanding how to productionalize LLMs into an application and discovering ways to utilize them fully, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and defining evaluation criteria.

### Datasets
We plan to use the following datasets:
- **Loads of Learning**: Free complete textbook series PDFs for grades 1-8.
  - Link: [Loads of Learning](https://www.loadsoflearning.com/free-complete-textbook-series-pdfs)
- **Freekidsbooks**: Free PDFs of kids' textbooks for grades 1-8.
  - Link: [Freekidsbooks](https://freekidsbooks.org/subject/school-textbooks/)
- **Project Gutenberg**: Thousands of free textbooks.
  - Link: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
- **Internet Archive**: Thousands of older but useful textbooks.
  - Link: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
- **Children’s Book Test**: A raw, tokenized version of many children's books.

We will ensure that the datasets used do not have any usage restrictions or require licenses for redistribution.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Our MVP will be a functional application, either web or mobile, that includes an LLM and associated models. The application will take user input (texts, homework problems, etc.) and return outputs that help educate children. We will also provide the codebase and a comprehensive writeup.

### Ethical Challenges
- **Inclusivity**: Ensuring the application represents a wide variety of interests and individuals.
- **Access**: Addressing the potential disparity in access to digital tools among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

### Technical Challenges
- **Large Datasets**: Handling large datasets for model fine-tuning.
- **Data Cleaning**: Managing the complexity of cleaning diverse educational content.
- **Productionalizing LLMs and RAG**: Implementing a complex machine learning pipeline.
- **Real-time Inference**: Ensuring timely responses from the model.

### Evaluation
Evaluating the output of an LLM is subjective and complex. We plan to use standardized metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, as well as custom evaluation metrics to assess the cohesiveness, engagement, and accuracy of the generated content. Additional evaluation methods include using another LLM for assessment, manual evaluation, and human panel surveys to ensure the model's outputs are appropriate and engaging for children.

### Team Roles
We will define team roles based on each member's skills and interests as we progress. Roles may include Project Manager, Lead Developer, Lead Analyst, etc. Our goal is to ensure all members contribute effectively throughout the project duration.

### Required Resources
- **Cloud Computing**: Great Lakes, Google Colab, AWS, or GCP.
- **Advising**: Additional guidance on Gen AI, LLMs, RAG, Langchain, and fine-tuning models.
- **Budget**: Potential financial support for hiring a human panel for evaluation.

### Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Dr. O'Brien and the broader MADS staff for their support and guidance in this project.
